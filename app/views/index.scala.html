	<h2 class="visuallyhidden">Summary</h2>
	<p>In 2014 <a href="http://www.icosystem.com">Icosystem</a>, funded by a grant from <a href="http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org">The Rockefeller Foundation</a>, created a software model of the Mindoro Philippines tuna fishery value chain 
	from fish stock to consumer. Currently the Mindoro tuna fishery is being fished sustainably<a class="ref" href="@routes.Application.aboutMindoroTunaFishery()">1</a>.
    This is expected to change as increasing global demand leads to increased profits, inducing overfishing<a class="ref" href="">2</a>. This model was used to improve our understanding of the impact that potential interventions could have on the sustainability of fish stocks and livelihoods of traditional tuna fishers. <a href="@routes.Application.aboutTheModel()">read more</a></p>
