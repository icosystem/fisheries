<h2 class="pagetitle">Interventions can backfire</h2>


<p> Interventions aimed at increasing fishers' profit margins (e.g. by providing subsidized fishing gear, facilities, and so on) can 
result in new fishers joining the fishery from other vulnerable regions. Even though supporting more fishers is a social benefit at the 
national level, the added effort threatens fish stocks. In the long run, it is very easy for productivity-aimed interventions to disrupt 
the stock-fishers equilibrium, leading to a stock collapse and thus having an overall negative effect in the end.</p>
